# Overtime & Side Projects

## **Overtime**

We generally don't want you to work overtime. We need your creativity and energy, and they require rest: on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.

On rare occasions — reaching a publicly committed deadline or solving a production emergency — it might be necessary to work longer than usual. We expect you to do what is necessary and then take extra rest time at your judgement.

## **Side Projects**

Pet projects and other extra work activities are fine, provided that you are doing them for fun.

A results-only work environment requires trust and full commitment, so it's not ok to work overtime on other commercial projects or do side jobs, unless explicitly agreed upon.
