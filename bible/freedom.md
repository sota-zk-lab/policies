# Freedom

We love freedom: the ability to do what you want and not do what you hate.

We wanted to be in the flow, tackling exciting technological problems on the edge of the complexity of what our minds could handle — and experience the joy of accomplishment when the fruits of our work materialize. We hated bureaucracy with its stupid rules and limitations that are so often imposed by clueless people in positions of power.

This is something we want to share with you. We're doing our best to assemble a team of talented people who are self-motivated, love what they are doing, and enjoy the highest degree of autonomy.

But *freedom* is not just something that guides our work — it is the end goal. I'm convinced that **the single most impactful thing you can do today to make this world better is to increase people’s freedom**. More freedom is key to eliminating poverty, to creating equality of opportunity and more wealth for everyone, to enabling more fun and creativity, faster scientific and technological progress, and less injustice and suffering from corruption and oppression.

In [Recommendations](https://www.notion.so/Recommendations-06c4ef425ef4441a85300bacc33d29a4?pvs=21) you will find a selection of thought-provoking books and videos on this topic.

## **Moving fast!**

We have a small window of opportunity to make significant progress towards our mission.

Imagine an alternate history where the Internet Protocol (IP) doesn’t get traction. The Internet is a collection of paid data services offered by large providers: AOL, AT&T, Deutsche Telekom, etc.

- Need a weather forecast? Here is our $5 a month subscription!
- Gotta send that email? That’ll be $2 per recipient (remember Bill Gates coming up with this idea “to prevent spam”?).
- Oh, your correspondent is on a different continent? Here is a 30% overseas-surcharge.

Was this scenario unlikely? Not at all. We just got extremely lucky. Would it prevent the Internet in its current form from ever coming to fruition? Probably not. But we could’ve been thrown back by a decade or even five (the latter is what happened to the medical use of psychedelics or the nuclear energy industry).

Now look at the world of financial services or app store duopoly. Notice any similarities?

If we don’t move fast and change the status quo quickly, everyone will be forced into the same compliance hell as the traditional banking system. Or big tech will continue to expand their influence in the digital realm in [their pursuit to tax every online transaction](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/13/meta-plans-to-take-a-nearly-50percent-cut-on-nft-sales-in-its-metaverse.html#:~:text=A%20Meta%20spokesperson%20confirmed%20to,for%20its%20virtual%20reality%20headsets.). It won’t stop the digital revolution from thriving eventually. But it can very well impede adoption before crypto reaches escape velocity.

Accelerating adoption requires several things.

## **Awesome products**

Remember [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy)? How many people do you know who use it to encrypt their daily communication?

Now contrast this with instant messengers secured via embedded end-to-end encryption. Nearly universal adoption.

To accomplish our mission, our products must look and feel awesome, so users are eager to switch. We must build products without compromising our foundational values or the elegance of the systems we build. This is true with regard to both end-users (awesome UI/UX) and developers (awesome SDK/API/docs).

## Steady **shipping**

We are embracing a culture of pragmatism. Perfectionism should not stand in the way of frequent releases.

We are continuously looking out for ways to increase shipping speed without trading off security, reliability, and maintainability of our code. Less distractions, less context switching, less [bikeshedding](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/bikeshedding). Clearer priorities, more powerful machines to compile faster, more intelligent CI tools to run tests faster, etc., etc.

**You are responsible for determining what you need to be fast (and pushing for it!).** Management of the company is responsible for supplying those needs.

## **Security and reliability**

Self-sovereign finance means that users have full control over their financial assets and can access them at any time. This is the bold promise we give to our users.

Like a minesweeper, we have no margin for errors. If user funds are ever stolen or frozen, we have failed our mission miserably and should’ve better not started at all. It’s unlikely that there will ever be a second chance.

In the world of blockchain, we are operating in the harshest adversarial environment imaginable — a true digital jungle (or [a dark forest](https://medium.com/@danrobinson/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest-ecc5f0505dff), if you prefer). In contrast to secret services or traditional cyber-security companies, we don’t have the luxury of [security by obscurity and security by isolation](https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2008/09/three-approaches-to-computer-security.html). Everything we do is public, open, and directly exposed to attackers.

Thus, treat potential attackers with the highest respect — expect them to be limitlessly intelligent. Turn on paranoia mode. **If something bad can potentially happen, it will happen.**

> *Success breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure. Only the paranoid survive.*

If, on the other hand, our system is even temporarily unavailable, we’re letting down people who trusted it with their money. Such a situation is a disgrace and will cost us our reputation — but that’s not even the worst part. The systems we’re building are already being used by many poor people in developing countries. For these people, a delay in payment can cause real pain and suffering.

To prevent this, we follow the example of safety-critical industries (aviation, nuclear, healthcare): Always be pessimistic, expect any single component to fail at any time, no matter how unlikely. Handle failures gracefully and design for redundancy.

## **Our values and You**

You don't have to agree with everything above — but if you join out team, we expect you to understand and commit to our mission.
