# PROGRAMMING CONVENTIONS

## Git Practices

- **Rebasing Strategy:** Embrace the use of the rebase strategy in our Git workflow. This approach enhances commit history clarity and promotes a cleaner repository.
- **No Main Branch**: No direct committing to the main branch. Create new branch from the main branch and then create a PR to merge it.

## Pull Requests Review

- **Deadline:** Every pull request MUST be reviewed by ALL members within a day (unless there is a specific reason not to do so). We require this so that everyone knows what others are doing and shares common responsibility.

## Work Artifact

- Every piece of work needs to be documented in a Git repository that meets at least level 1 standard.

Standard:
1. Summary of your docs/chapter, main takeaways, application: Is it worth reading? Did you gain anything from it?
2. Brief explanation about every sub-chapter.
3. Reintroduce that docs/chapter in your own words, use images, teach someone else, and explain how to make it more understandable.

## Language-Specific Conventions

- **To Be Determined (TBD):** Specific conventions for programming languages will be outlined and documented. TBD placeholders are subject to future updates as language-specific requirements are identified and agreed upon.

Adhering to these programming conventions contributes to a cohesive and efficient development process. As language-specific conventions are established, they will be added to ensure consistency across our codebase. Collaborative input and suggestions for improvements are encouraged through the standard Pull Request (PR) process. Thank you for your commitment to maintaining a standardized and effective coding environment.
