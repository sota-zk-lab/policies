# PROGRAMMING CONVENTIONS

## Git Practices

- **Rebasing Strategy:** Embrace the use of the rebase strategy in our Git workflow. This approach enhances commit history clarity and promotes a cleaner repository.
- **No Main Branch**: No direct committing to the main branch. Create new branch from the main branch and then create a PR to merge it.

## Language-Specific Conventions

- **To Be Determined (TBD):** Specific conventions for programming languages will be outlined and documented. TBD placeholders are subject to future updates as language-specific requirements are identified and agreed upon.

Adhering to these programming conventions contributes to a cohesive and efficient development process. As language-specific conventions are established, they will be added to ensure consistency across our codebase. Collaborative input and suggestions for improvements are encouraged through the standard Pull Request (PR) process. Thank you for your commitment to maintaining a standardized and effective coding environment.
