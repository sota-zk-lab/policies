# PUNISHMENT POLICY

## Purpose
The primary objective of this policy is to ensure adherence to established rules within our team. 

These penalties, in the form of monetary fines, serve as a _gentle_ reminder for individuals who fail to adhere to the defined rules. 
All funds accumulated throughout each month will be allocated towards a team-related purchase at the end of the month.

## What is X?
X represents the number of instances an individual violates a specific rule within a given month. This count is reset at the beginning of each month.

## Penalty Structure
The following penalties are in place for rule violations:

- **Failed to join meeting on time:** X * 25K
- **Failed to prepare before meetings:** X * 25K
- **Failed to notify the team before sudden leave (at least 1 day notice):** X * 100K
- **Failed to adhere to the programming convention:** X * (TBD)

These fines aim to emphasize the importance of punctuality, preparation, and communication within our team.

We appreciate everyone's cooperation in maintaining a positive and disciplined environment, contributing to the overall well-being of the team.
