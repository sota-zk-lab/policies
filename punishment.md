[Note](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nc1oUmABtBJZWAF-iGjJNmUItC6HeZmg7q7HYxObYhA/edit?usp=sharing)

## Bank account
- **Bank:** Cake
- **Account number:** 0333888648
- **Holder:** Nguyen Thanh Son

## Purpose
The primary objective of this policy is to ensure adherence to established rules within our team.

These penalties, in the form of monetary fines, serve as a _gentle_ reminder for individuals who fail to adhere to the defined rules.
All funds accumulated throughout each month will be allocated towards a team-related purchase at the end of the month.

## What is X?
X represents the number of instances an individual violates a specific rule within a given month. This count is reset at the beginning of each month.

## Penalty Structure
The following penalties are in place for rule violations:

- **Failed to join the meeting on time:** :coffee: * X
- **Failed to prepare before meetings (i.e. document your work in the chat [meetings](meetings.md)):** :coffee: * X
- **Failed to notify the team before a sudden leave (at least 1 day notice):** :coffee::coffee: * X
- **Failed to adhere to the programming convention:** :coffee: * X (TBD)

Notes: Use :coffee: as the unit so that we don't need to redefine this in the future due to inflation. :coffee: = 30K with the current price.

These fines aim to emphasize the importance of punctuality, preparation, and communication within our team.

We appreciate everyone's cooperation in maintaining a positive and disciplined environment, contributing to the overall well-being of the team.
