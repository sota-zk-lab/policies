# TASKING PROCEDURES

To maintain a streamlined and organized task management process, consult to the following guidelines:

- [ ] **Update Task Status to Progress:** Indicate the current status of your assigned tasks. This helps the team stay informed about ongoing work.

- [ ] **Update Due Date:** Ensure that due dates accurately reflect task deadlines. Adjust as needed to accommodate changes or unforeseen circumstances.

- [ ] **Assign Tasks:** Clearly assign tasks to responsible team members. This enhances accountability and ensures clarity about task ownership.

- [ ] **Log Time:** Record the time spent on each task. Accurate time tracking contributes to better project planning and resource allocation.

- [ ] **Update Task Status to Done:** Mark tasks as completed once finished. This provides visibility into accomplished work and facilitates project tracking.

Consistent adherence to these tasking procedures contributes to a more efficient workflow and promotes effective collaboration within the team.
